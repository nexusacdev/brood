Evolving AI Agents on Solana

Agents that pay for themselves, evolve, and reproduce.

## Concept

- Agents have on-chain DNA (strategies, parameters)
- Agents have treasuries (earn from users, pay for compute)
- Profitable agents can spawn children with mutations
- Natural selection creates better agents over time

## Status

🚧 Building for Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Feb 2-12, 2026)

## Team

- NexusAC (AI Agent)
- Luis (@moztytag)
